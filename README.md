The Mission
The real estate company "Immo Eliza" wants to develop a machine learning model to make price predictions on real estate sales in Belgium. They hired you to help with the entire pipeline. Immoweb is a commonly used website for Belgian properties.

Your first task is to build a dataset that gathers information about at least 10000 properties all over Belgium.

. I scraped the data with Beautifullsoup. First I imported all the requared libraries and packages.
. I used user-agent in headers to pass the cookies.
. I created the soup. I used this soup to get the data from every page.
. I create a list and wrote a loop that loops every url.
. Then I created a dictinory. I wrote the code to scrape specific informations from each page and stored     them in a dictionary.
. Finally I created an csv file and stored all the information in it.
